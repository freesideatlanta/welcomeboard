# Welcomeboard
Welcomeboard is the app that runs the api called by the welcome board in the front of the freeside atlanta space. 
This project was completely unauthorized and unsanctioned as an act of defiance of the new leadership (who are probably lovely people, but Nate didn't know them at the time)

# Running
`go run main.go` or `go build main.go && ./main`

in reality, you'll probably want to run this through a systemd service. That's likely the smart way to do it.
